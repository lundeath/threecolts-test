## Threecolts Java hiring test

### The process

Please implement the 2 functions as described in the com.threecolts.hiring.HiringTest file.

Requirements:

- Do not edit the build.gradle.kts. In particular, do not add any libraries to it
- Your implementation should not have any compiler errors
- All your code should exist within a single file that implements HiringTest
- Please name your file/class com.threecolts.hiring.FirstNameLastNameHiringTestImpl.java
- If you write tests, these can live in a separate file. You can use JUnit for them

At the end of the hour, please:

- Attach your solution FirstNameLastNameHiringTestImpl.java to the form
- Optional: if you wrote any tests, please attach them to the same form

If you have any questions take your best guess. 
After delivering the solution, feel free to send comments or questions our way,

Best of luck,
The Threecolts team
